 2. Name→**Description of  your key** 
 3. Trigger Key → e.g., **ahk**  or  ^q  (**Ctrl Q**)
 You Can Combine with your own symbols like
- __For Hotstrings :__
- - <gm, *abc , [abc and etc..
- __For HotKeys :__
- - ^R – Control and W
- - !+R – Alt shift and R
  - (^ means Ctrl, ! means Alt, + means Shift)
4. Action Text → The auto-inserted full text
